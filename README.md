-   Open the project folder in a terminal:

          npm install              # fetches dependencies
          npm start                # builds an application and starts the development server

## Description

_Zoom Band Chart_.

This example showcases the Zoom Band Chart feature.
This is a chart type intended for displaying a duplicate, zoomed out view of 1 or more charts/series.
The Zoom Band Chart comes with convenient built-in interactions that allow the user to select the view on the full data set. Interacting with the Zoom Band Chart in that way mirrors the changes on the original, attached charts.

The Zoom Band Chart can be created with few simple lines of code:

```javascript
const zoomBandChart = lc.ZoomBandChart()
zoomBandChart.add(mySeries1)
zoomBandChart.add(mySeries2)
```

Please find more detailed documentation of Zoom Band Chart features and commonly used methods in the [API documentation](https://lightningchart.com/js-charts/api-documentation) under `ZoomBandChart` class.
